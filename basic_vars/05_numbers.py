'''
NOTE: this is another type of comment in python called a multi-line comment where the comment goes over multiple lines
      (it's actually just a string, but because it doesn't do anything, we think of it as a comment)
      the lines starting with # are not strings and are just regular comments

      this file will give more practice working with numbers

# Here are the operations you can do between numbers
a = 10
b = 3

c = a + b   # addition
c = a - b   # subtraction
c = a * b   # multiplication
c = a / b   # floating point division (no rounding)
c = a // b  # integer division (rounds down)
c = a % b   # remdainer (calculates the remainder when dividing 'a' by 'b')


# ========
# PRACTICE
# ========

# 0. Define three numbers a, b, and c, with the values 29, 4, and 19, respectively (what are their types?)

# 1. compute the remainder when a is divided by 4 and store it in a variable that is named well

# 2. compute the mean of a, b, and c and store it in a well-named variable
