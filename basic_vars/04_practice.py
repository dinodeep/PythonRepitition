# NOTE: name your variables wisely (for example: if variale stores your age, don't name it 'x', name it 'age')

# write code that
#       0. takes in one number as a string from the terminal using the 'input(...)' function
#       1. converts that number to an integer for doing number operations on it
#       2. cubes the number using the ** operation and then subtracts by 1
#       3. prints the number

# write code that
#       0. takes in two numbers with two calls to the input(...) function
#       1. converts both to integers
#       2. multiply them together
#       3. adds the second number to the result of step 2
#       4. print True if the result is less than 15 or greater than 25, False otherwise

# write code that
#       0. takes in three numbers (a, b, and c in order) with three calls to input(...) function
#       1. converts all three to integers
#       2. prints True if any ordering of the numbers satisfies a right triangle False otherwise

# write code that
#       0. takes in four numbers (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) with four calls to input(...) function
#       1. converts all four to integers
#       2. calculates the slope between points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1)
#       3. calculates the x-intercept of the line going through points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1)
#       4. calculates the y-intercept
#       5. prints the slope, x-intercept, y-intercept
#       7. prints the equation of the line going through (x0, y0) and (x1, y1)
#          using the y = mx + b format

# write code that COMPUTES ANNUAL COMPOUND INTEREST
#       0. takes in a initial amount of money, an interest rate (in between 0 and 1), and the number of years
#       1. convert all values to floats using the float(...) function (its similar to how str(...) and int(...) are used)
#       2. compute the resulting money after the provided number of years using the formula: A = P(1 + r)^n
#               n = the number of years
#               r = the interest rate in between 0 and 1
#               A = the result after n years
#       3. print: "After _ years, you will have $_" where the first _ is the number of years and the second _ is the resulting value
